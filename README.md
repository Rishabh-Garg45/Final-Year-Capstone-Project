# YOLOv8-Based Real-Time Underwater Fish Monitoring Framework

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final report and results for the capstone project titled **"YOLOv8-Based Real-Time Underwater Fish Monitoring Framework: Detection, Tracking, and Counting."** The project utilizes the YOLOv8 deep learning architecture to detect, track, and count fish in underwater environments, supporting aquatic research, conservation efforts, and fisheries management.

## Features
- Real-time fish detection using YOLOv8.
- Robust tracking and counting in diverse underwater conditions.
- Detailed results and performance analysis documented in the report.

## Repository Structure
- **`/report/`**: Contains the final project report in PDF format. The report includes all visualizations and analysis of the detection, tracking, and counting results.

## Confidentiality Notice
The code for this project is confidential and is not included in this repository. If required for academic or research purposes, please contact.

## Results
The results include:
- Model performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
- Visual outputs of fish detection, tracking, and counting under various underwater scenarios.
- Detailed analysis of challenges and proposed solutions for underwater environments.

For more information, refer to the **report** in the `/report/` directory.
